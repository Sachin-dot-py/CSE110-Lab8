> How are graceful degradation and service workers related? 

Using service workers facilitates graceful degradation, since graceful degradation is about maintaining a system's ability to keep its basic functionality, even when certain components fail. Service workers let us cache data so that app degrades gracefully by loading from cache instead, if the network fails, instead of failing entirely. Thus, the website can remain usable by the user.
